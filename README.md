## A short description of your app (its purpose and features)
* Login screen: users can enter their username and click login
* Home screen: users can view a recycler view of available posts and enter text into the search field
* Tag screen: users can view the posts created by other uses under the same tag
* Meme screen: users can upload a picture and add text to the picture to create the meme
* Profile screen: user can see their username and profile picture and a list of memes they have created
* Post screen: user can click in each individual post image and the caption added
* The user first logs in, then goes to the home screen to view posts. If they are interested in a specific category of post, they can search for a tag and see only posts of that tag. Then, they can post in the tag. They can also navigate to the profile screen to view a list of posts they have and click on them to see more information about the individual post. 
* For networking, we use GET requests to get the posts from the backend. We also use the POST request when adding a new post. 


##  Android: 
* A completed Recycler View with a custom adapter;
* Use of either 3rd party API, networking, or persistent storage;
* 3 fully functional screens.

## Backend:
* 7 routes (4 GET, 3 POST). Routes for user authorization are also implemented.
* 3 tables (posts, tags, users) in database with a relation between posts and tags, posts and users
